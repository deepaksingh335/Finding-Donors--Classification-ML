    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "\n",
    "##### Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. \n",
    "  Logistic Regression can be used in real world applications such as : \n",
    "  - Credit Scoring\n",
    "  - Measuring the success rates of marketing campaigns\n",
    " \n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "  -  Outputs have a nice probabilistic interpretation, and the algorithm can be regularized to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "  - Logistic regression tends to underperform when there are  non-linear decision boundaries\n",
    "  \n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "  - Since we need to determine if the person has income more than 50K we can use the logistic regression to take a probabilistic approach in this classification problem. Also , considering the size of the data, Logistic regression can take less runtime.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "##### Decision Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. \n",
    "  Decision tree can be used in real world applications such as : \n",
    "  - Classifying the apps to suggest on appstore\n",
    "  - Predicting the weather\n",
    " \n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "  -  Decision trees implicitly perform variable screening or feature selection. Can handle multi-output problems. Non-linear relationships between features do not affect model performance\n",
    "  \n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "  - Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not generalize the data well. This is called overfitting.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "  - Since we need to determine if the person has income more than 50K i.e. 0 or 1 we can fit the DT and see the performance. Also, DT will take care of any non-liner features in the dataset in addition to less runtime\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### SVM\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. \n",
    "  - SVM can be used in real world applications such as predicting if the company will become insolvent using the financial ratios\n",
    "   \n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "  -  when the features has non linear decision boundaries. SVMs might be computationally better than other classifying algorithms\n",
    "  \n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "  - disadvantages include not giving output probabilities and being rather cumbersome for multi output problems\n",
    "  \n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "  - Since we need to determine if the person has income more than 50K i.e. 0 or 1 we can fit the SVM and compare the performances of the models.The model could be a good candidate as there seems to be some features in the data that can more clearly define the income level boundary"

    " In my opinion, the most appropriate solution to this problem would be achieved using the Logistic Regression model. As it can be observed from the plots, in comparison to SVC, both the Logistic regression and the Decision Tree algorithms are capable of both training on the entire data set and quickly performing predictions. However, decision tree shows much higer accuracy score and fbeta score in training than in testing which is a sign of overfitting. Also, In terms of the Fbeta score, Logistic regression slightly outperforms SVC and DT at all training set sizes for model predciting.\n",
    "\n",
    "When weighing all of these attributes, we can conclude that Logistic Regression is best suited for this problem. We will be able to fully utilize the entire dataset to maximize the performance in the unseen data without compromising on training and testing the speeds. Also, since we are more interested in maximizing the number of accurately classified people that make more than 50K, this model, which has the highest accuracy, seems to be the most appropriate."

    "Since our objective is to predict if the persons income is more than 50K or not, we will use logistic regression for the predictions.Logistic regression is generally used where the dependent variable is Binary or Dichotomous. That means there can two possible outcomes such as “Yes or No”.\n",
    "Logistic regression makes predictions using probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "  0 = we are absolutely sure that the person's income is less than equal to 50000\n",
    "  \n",
    "  1 = we are absolutely sure that the person's income is greater than  50000\n",
    "    \n",
    "Any value above 0.5 = we are pretty sure about that person is making more than 50K. Say we predict 0.8, then we are 80% confident that the person has income more than 50K. Likewise, any value below 0.5 we can say with a corresponding degree of confidence that the person's income is less than 50K.Logistic regression uses the concept of odds ratios to calculate the probability. This is defined as the ratio of the odds of an event happening to its not happening\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying algorithm of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) determines the regression coefficient for the model that accurately predicts the probability of the binary dependent variable. Logistic Regression uses the logistic function to find a model that fits with the data points. The function gives an 'S' shaped curve to model the data. The curve is restricted between 0 and 1, so it is easy to apply when outcome is binary. \n",

Nevertheless, this algorithm gives these two features higher weights as their data probably contains better indicators of income level of the people which aids the algorithm in defining a stronger and more accurate decision boundary. On the other hand, I did expected Age, hours-per-week and education number to be part of the driving predictive features due to the reasons mentioned in my answer to the question above."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
